# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    prefer_single_quotes: true  # 强制使用单引号
    # 额外的推荐规则
    always_declare_return_types: true  # 总是声明返回类型
    avoid_print: true  # 避免使用 print
    prefer_final_fields: true  # 优先使用 final 字段
    unnecessary_this: true  # 避免不必要的 this

analyzer:
  errors:
    # 将所有 info 和 warning 都视为 error，强制修复
    include_file_not_found: error
    todo: ignore
    # 针对特定规则升级为 error
    avoid_print: error # 禁止使用 print，必须用 log
    prefer_single_quotes: error # 强制单引号
    # 忽略 PMlog 的命名警告（这是故意的设计）
    non_constant_identifier_names: ignore

  # 或者使用 exclude 排除不想检查的文件（如生成代码）
  exclude:
    - "**/*.g.dart"
    - "**/*.freezed.dart"
